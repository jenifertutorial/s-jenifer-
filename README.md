SOURCE CODE  

For example, in Python:

def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name)

greet("Alice")

This is source code. It can be compiled or interpreted by a computer to perform tasks â€” in this case, printing a greeting.

1. Data Collection and Analysis

Source code can gather and analyze customer data like:

Browsing history

Purchase behavior

Demographics

Feedback and reviews


Example (Python - simplified):

def recommend_products(purchase_history):
    if "laptop" in purchase_history:
        return ["Laptop Bag", "Mouse", "Keyboard"]
    return ["Popular Deals"]

print(recommend_products(["laptop", "headphones"]))

2. Email or Notification Personalization

Automatically sending tailored messages based on user actions.

Example:

def send_email(user_name, favorite_product):
    print(f"Hi {user_name}, check out discounts on {favorite_product}!")

send_email("Anita", "smartphones")

3. Dynamic Website Content

Web apps can show different content to different users based on their interests.

Example (pseudo-code for a website):

if user.interest == "sports":
    show("Sports Deals")
else:
    show("Trending Now")

4. Chatbots and Customer Support

Source code powers AI chatbots that provide customized support based on user history.
